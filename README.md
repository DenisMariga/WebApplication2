Introduction
Welcome to the ASP.NET and React web application project! This application is designed to showcase a simple yet effective implementation of a web API back-end combined with a user-friendly front-end using React. The project allows users to manage Departments and Employees within those departments through a user interface.

ASP.NET Web API: Provides the back-end infrastructure to handle HTTP requests and manage data using a RESTful API architecture.
React: The front-end is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Entity Framework Core: Used for object-relational mapping (ORM) to interact with the database.
SQL Server: The database engine for storing department and employee data.
HTML/CSS: For creating the user interface and styling.
Bootstrap: A front-end CSS framework to enhance the application's visual appeal and responsiveness.
Axios: A JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests to the Web API from the React front-end.
